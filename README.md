# Richie-Frontend-Portfolio

This is the current front-end portfolio, It is a work in progress and I dont think ill ever necessarily be done with it. My inspiration for the project came from me wanting to have a sand box repository where I can build what ever I wanted. Currently this is a full stack project where i have my resume as my home page and a few apps I plan on building.
